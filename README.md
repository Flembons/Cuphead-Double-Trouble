# Cuphead Double Trouble
A mod for Cuphead that spawns two bosses at once. Any boss can be combined with any other boss, so there's over 800 boss combinations to try out!

WARNING: Cuphead was never meant to have two bosses in a single fight, so some fights may break or be impossible to beat!

### Mod Options:

* **Boss Type**
  * SAME - Two copies of the same boss will spawn. This is the default starting option
  * RANDOM - A random boss will spawn as the second boss
  * CHOOSE - Select any of the 40 bosses to be the second boss
    
* **Base Health**
  * Set your starting health between 1 and 9 to make fights easier or more difficult
  * You can also turn on God Mode by setting your health to âˆž

How to Install

Extract the zip in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cuphead (or wherever you have Cuphead installed)

How to Play
===

1. Start the game and check if "Mod Options" is an option in the Pause Menu. If not, the mod is not installed correctly.

2. Enter any boss fight in the game, and a second boss will spawn in alongside the first boss. By default, the second boss will be the same as the first, but this can be changed in Mod Options.

### **This mod currently only supports Cuphead version 1.3.4 with or without the Delicious Last Course DLC installed!**
